using the standard `\includegraphics` command from the `graphics` or `graphicx` packages   The article _identifier system has been updated_ The new scheme which does not include subject information in the identifier not only allows for a greater number of submissions each month but it makes reclassification easier old identifiers did not permit changes in primary classication after announcement  We also hope that the removal of optional subject-class information from the identifier will lead to more consistent citation and linking   To find a specific paper for which you know the identifier you may now simply type or paste the identifier e g `hep-th ` ` ` or `arXiv ` into the _search box at the top of every arXiv page_ This facility replaces the abs links for each archive that used to be on the main page   The _abstract pages have been redesigned_ to more cleanly present the most important information title authors abstract etc  and to allow more links to related services to be added in column on the right See for example arXiv   The _Statistics archive_ was introduced on April   The category `math IT` was created as an alias for _Information Theory_ `cs IT` so that these papers will

into a new Mathematical Physics archive math-ph xxx lanl gov  to which future submissions should be sent  If you are notsure whether or not your submission is physics then it should be sent tomath-ph  Submissions will also automatically appear under a MP =Mathematical Physics subject class of the math archive and as usual can becross-listed elsewhere Current e-mail subscribers to Mathematical Methods inPhysics will automatically be subscribed to the new archive Current mathsubscribers can add the MP subject class starting Apr Mar India users note new Indian mirror at http  xxx imsc ernet in   Jan Jan The PDF produced here now includes subsetted embedded fonts This was madefeasible by the new font compression format CFF Type  introduced in PDF- see Nov  This more compactified Type format reduced the byte costof font inclusion by more than a factor of three Note that not all PDF viewers support the font compression format e g underNeXTStep only PDFView app   supports it while the current versions ofOmniPDF app   and PDFViewer app do not support it    Dec Dec The math archives will be reorganized starting January  The archivesalg-geom dg-ga funct-an and q-alg will be subsumed as subject classes inthe new math archive started  -- see math info for more information The intent is to provide a better organized framework for coverage ofadditional mathematical subject areas Beginning Jan  q-alg submissionsfor example should be sent to math xxx lanl gov with the added line i e following Title  Author  etc   Subj-class  Quantum Algebra  the AMS Mathematical Subject Classification s should now appear on an  MSC-class  line  Submissions to q-alg xxx lanl gov will be automaticallyrerouted as above and assigned numbers beginning with math QA  As areplacement for the cross-listing mechanism between math archives  usemultiple Subj-class entries separated by 's the first is the primary  Itis also possible to subscribe to receive daily abstract notifications for anysubset of the math subject classes see math subscribe \-- current e-mailsubscribers will be automatically transferred  An external front end can be found at UC Davis front Dec Due to the healthy growth of the astro-ph archive we are considering a Subj-class organization similar to that which exists for the cond-mat and andphysics archives Suggested subject classes include Cosmology and Large ScaleStructure Extra-Galactic Astronomy Galactic Astronomy Stars and theInterstellar Medium Compact Objects Planetary Systems Stellar and GalacticDynamics High Energy Astrophysics Instrumentation and Methods History andEducation  The subject classes function effectively as separate archives though the collective astro-ph archive will of course continue to exist aswell  Please read astroreorg

quant-ph arxiv org  Subject subscribe John Smith   note that subscribing to subdivided archivies such as `cond-mat` in thisway will subscribe you to all subject classes within that archive    Handling subscriptions to all physics archives through`physics`  The `physics` archive can be used to subscribe to any combination of existingphysics archives e g to something like `General Relativity' `Astrophysics' and `High Energy Physics - Experimental' This is also the only way tosubscribe to a subset of the subject classes within the `astro-ph` `cond-mat`and `nlin` archives For example to subscribe only to the `cond-mat` subjectclasses `Soft Condensed Matter' and `Superconductivity' the email would read       To physics arxiv org  Subject subscribe John Smith    add Soft Condensed Matter  add Superconductivity  If you want to change from say subscribing to all of `astro-ph` tosubscribing to just `astro-ph EP` then you must first cancel the subscriptionto `astro-ph` and then subscribe to `EP` through the `physics` archive    To Cancel Your SubscriptionIf you want to cancel your receipt of the regular listings you can do so asfollows   Find the e-mail address of the archive for which you are receiving the listings   Send an e-mail message to the archive in the following form      To arch-ive arxiv org  Subject cancel  Here is an example       To quant-ph arxiv

submissions from thescientific communities our team has worked behind the scenes for a long timeto ensure the quality of our content Our policy is > _arXiv is an openly accessible moderated repository for scholarly papers inspecific scientific disciplines Material submitted to arXiv is expected to beof interest relevance and value to those disciplines arXiv reserves theright to reject or reclassify any submission _Moderation helps to ensure that arXiv content is relevant to current researchat much lower cost than conventional peer-reviewed journals so we cancontinue to offer free access to the scientific community and the generalpublic Although our system may be imperfect submissions that are determinedto be inappropriate for arXiv may be still be posted on other sites orsubmitted to peer-reviewed journals  What suggestions do moderators make?The arXiv moderators are experts in their fields and in the types ofsubmissions that are appropriate for their subject classifications Theyevaluate based on the content of the submission and the policies of arXiv arXiv moderators may recommend _reclassification_ or _removal_ of asubmission Reclassification is frequently suggested for subjectclassifications that are highly similar in order to make sure thatsubmissions are posted first to the most appropriate archive Cross-lists maythen be suggested for other archives that are also appropriateclassifications A submission that is cross-listed to another archive willstill be announced in the mailings to the alternative archive arXiv moderators will suggest the removal of a submission that violates arXivpolicies in some way Potential reasons for removal are   _Unrefereeable content _ arXiv accepts only submissions in the form of an article that would be refereeable by a conventional publication venue Papers that do not contain original or substantive research including undergraduate research course projects and research proposals may be removed Papers that contain inflammatory or fictitious content papers that use highly dramatic and mis-representative titles abstracts introductions or papers in need of significant review and revision may be removed   _Inappropriate format _ Abstract-only submissions presentations book announcements book reviews submissions without references calls for papers or advertisements may be removed We do not accept submissions with line numbers or submissions with watermarks   _Inappropriate topic _ While arXiv serves a variety of scientific communities not all subjects are currently covered Submissions that do not fit well into our current classification scheme may be removed and where possible redirected to a more appropriate repository   _Duplicated content _ If a moderator notices that a user has made many very similar submissions in a short amount of time or that a new submission is really a revision of a recent submission the moderator may request that the user consolidate the new submission into a replacement of the previous submission This helps ensure that arXiv is as useful as possible for all of the various communities publishing here and it can often help the author present a more unified body of research   _Submission of copyrighted material _ Authors must hold copyright over the entirety of the submission when the files are uploaded to arXiv arXiv cannot accept PDFs that have been downloaded from a publisher's website and contain a copyright statement or papers that contain material written by someone who has not authorized that content to be distributed on arXiv including comments by referees and of course plagiarized material   _Excessive submission rate _ Articles submitted to arXiv must be of refereeable quality and there is a practical limit to the rate at which appropriate independent submissions can be produced by any one person Moderators may request that a particular author limit their submission rate if this author has a history of many submissions to inappropriate areas or of doubtful refereeability  Can I appeal a moderation decision?If you disagree with a moderation decision you should submit an appeal thatexplains clearly and succinctly what your arguments are   Send a precise email including all relevant details especially paper ids former correspondence submission summaries etc  to moderation arxiv org   If you receive an automated response to your email please read all instructions carefully  If there is no other identifying information in your message e g paper id orrejection id  you may need to address your email with  Dear arXiv-moderation   to bypass our SPAM filter   The moderators are not referees and do not provide detailed feedback on submissions Administrators thus cannot provide detailed feedback regarding submissions deemed inappropriate and will not enter into extended discussion regarding submissions   Please be _patient_  as moderation appeals are complicated and may take some time   In some cases we may require that a paper be published in a conventional journal before an appeal is considered The appeals process allows moderators additional time to reconsider asubmission but repeated appeals with no additional information cannot beconsidered If you send an appeal and the moderators reach the same decisionas they did initially no further appeal should be submitted Extreme casesmay be addressed to the appropriate advisory committee chair only  Who are the arXiv moderators?arXiv moderators are volunteer subject specialists who have been approved bytheir discipline-level advisory committees and by arXiv staff Although the moderators may be publicly acknowledged it is very inappropriateto contact any moderator directly regarding your submission All communicationabout moderation decisions should be addressed to moderation arxiv org or inextreme cases the appropriate advisory committee chair Moderators areencouraged not to reply to personal correspondence regarding
